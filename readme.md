A very simple script that ocr's an image to text.

The pip install script can be found here:
https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/  

The tesseract executable can be found here:
https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki  

Todo:
* Separate logic into methods
* Allow users to import their own image file
* Correct misaligned, rotated, or warped images
